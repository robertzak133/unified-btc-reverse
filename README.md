# unified-btc-reverse

This repository contains tools, source file, hand patches, and documentation for the entire Browning BTC trail cameara reversing new .BRN file creation.  

It is the third reorganziation of this effort, and it is aimed at preserving as much commonality between camera platforms as possible.  For example, by containing a single set of tools and source code for all targeted cameras.

It also includes a unfiied google Colab worksheet and local makefiles for a semi-automatic build environment.

Vision is that when I add a new feature in the source code, I press a button, and a new set of .BRN files are generated for all supported camera targets.
