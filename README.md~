# unified-btc-reverse

This repository contains tools, source file, hand patches, and documentation for the (nearly) complete flow for adding new features, written in C, to Browning Trail Cameras via semi-automatically generated firmware update files.  Supported cameras are BTC{7,8}e{, HP4, HP5} 

It is the third reorganziation of this effort, and it is aimed at preserving as much commonality between camera platforms as possible.  For example, by containing a single set of tools and source code for all targeted cameras.
