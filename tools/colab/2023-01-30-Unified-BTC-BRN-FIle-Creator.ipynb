This option removes that limit, allowing illuminated videos of the same duration as daylight videos.\n"," * Custom Info Strip: Adds \"seconds\" to the time of day; adds battery percent; compresses the size of the browning logo so it doesn't extend up into the main screen space.  \n"," * Custom Volume/Directory/Filenames: Normally, this camera renames the SD card \"volume\"  to \"BROWNING\", in folders in DCIM called xxxBTCF, in files called IMG_xxxx.  With this modification, these labels are all taken from the camera name, as set by the user.  Note that only the first 5 and 4 characters are used for the folder and file suffix/prefix respectively.  Thus, for camera name, \"MYCAMERA\", the SD card will be labeled \"MYCAMERA\" and files can be found in DCIM/100MYCAME/MYCA0001.JPG.  Any \"space\" in the first 5 characters is replaced by an \"underscore\".\n"," * DSLR Trigger: Causes the \"aim led\" to turn on whenever a photo or video is taken.  This LED can be used to trigger a DSLR camera, while also allowing the trail camera to take photos or video.\n"," * Extended SD Power: Causes the CPU and SD card to remain powered on for 30 seconds after each photo or video.  This to allow shared SD card to be read by another device.  Note that during this time, the camera will not trigger.\n"," * Time and Date Format Options: Added options for time format -- 12H/24H; and date formats MM/DD/YYYY; DD/MM/YYYY; YYYYMMDD.  The time format also applies to the set date/time menu, allowing time to set in 24-hour format (vs. AM/PM)\n"," * IR Power: Added an \"Off\" setting which prevents the camera from using any IR illumination for black and white night images.  For use with external (IR) light sources.\n"," * Daytime Thereshold: Shifts the threshold at which camera takes day vs. night pictures down to allow color photos with less light.  There is an \"No Light\" option which causes the camera to take color images, without illumination, even when dark.  Can be used with external (white) light sources.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"AaKEVE1YhnHb"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Ms2WW6_QKGYD"},"source":["### Mounting My Google Drive\n","The method is described under this Colab code snippet: https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/io.ipynb#scrollTo=u22w3BFiOveA.

I've found it's really easy to \"brick\" these cameras, or to leave them without a way of loading new (working) firmware from an SD card.  For this reason, I use a dedicated development camera in which I have removed the EEPROM and replaced with a removable ZIFF socket.  As long as I have a \"good\" impage for an  EEPROM, I can drop it in the ZIFF socket, and recover from firmware mistakes.  \n","\n","In this section, we generate an EERPOM binary file from the .BRN image, and from the EEPROM header (which is not included in the .BRN image).  I get the EEPROM header by \"sniffing\" it off the EEPROM in a working camera during power on with a logic analyzer *before* I remove the EEPROM.  The heat required to unsolder the EEPROM almost always leaves is empty, and often unable to store data.\n","\n","A few notes:\n","* Unless you use exactly the same EEPROM part (which may not be possible), you can't just make a copy of the factory EEPROM image for another EEPROM.  This is because the EEPROM header contains the device ID of the EEPROM type.  This gets checked during boot, and if the ID read from the EEPROM doesn't match what's been stored in teh header block, it will not load.\n","* You can't just change values in the EEPROM header.

I suspect they are target SOC-specific, and may contain data used to setup low level hardware, like the DRAM controller. In a pinch, these can be cribbed from images of other platforms, but it is easiest to get this header info from the target under development by \"sniffing\" the EEPROM signals during system power on (and boot). A low-cost USB logic analzyer (e.g. Kingst LA5016) turns the trace into a .CSV file.  This file, in turn, is parsed by utiliites below to produce a binary file.\n","\n","Note that this binary file only contains data that was read from the EEPROM.  In Browning Trail cameras, at least, this is not the whole EEPROM image.  Instated, it is just the executable code segment.  The A and B FAT12 File systems hosted on the EEPROM are \"demand\" loaded.\n","\n","I have also had some trouble getting accurate data from my low cost logic analyzer at the high data speeds used to transfer the bulk of the EEPROM image (to save time and reduce Trigger speed).  Glitches in the logic analyser trace, especially of the clock signal, confuse the parser, resulting in missing segments in the binary.\n","\n","My goal is to figure out where in the EEPROM the A and B file systems are stored.
