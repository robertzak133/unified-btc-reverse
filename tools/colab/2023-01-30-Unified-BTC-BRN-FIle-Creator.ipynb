This option removes that limit, allowing illuminated videos of the same duration as daylight videos.\n"," * Custom Info Strip: Adds \"seconds\" to the time of day; adds battery percent; compresses the size of the browning logo so it doesn't extend up into the main screen space.  \n"," * Custom Volume/Directory/Filenames: Normally, this camera renames the SD card \"volume\"  to \"BROWNING\", in folders in DCIM called xxxBTCF, in files called IMG_xxxx.  With this modification, these labels are all taken from the camera name, as set by the user.  Note that only the first 5 and 4 characters are used for the folder and file suffix/prefix respectively.  Thus, for camera name, \"MYCAMERA\", the SD card will be labeled \"MYCAMERA\" and files can be found in DCIM/100MYCAME/MYCA0001.JPG.  Any \"space\" in the first 5 characters is replaced by an \"underscore\".\n"," * DSLR Trigger: Causes the \"aim led\" to turn on whenever a photo or video is taken.  This LED can be used to trigger a DSLR camera, while also allowing the trail camera to take photos or video.\n"," * Extended SD Power: Causes the CPU and SD card to remain powered on for 30 seconds after each photo or video.  This to allow shared SD card to be read by another device.  Note that during this time, the camera will not trigger.\n"," * Time and Date Format Options: Added options for time format -- 12H/24H; and date formats MM/DD/YYYY; DD/MM/YYYY; YYYYMMDD.  The time format also applies to the set date/time menu, allowing time to set in 24-hour format (vs. AM/PM)\n"," * IR Power: Added an \"Off\" setting which prevents the camera from using any IR illumination for black and white night images.  For use with external (IR) light sources.\n"," * Daytime Thereshold: Shifts the threshold at which camera takes day vs. night pictures down to allow color photos with less light.  There is an \"No Light\" option which causes the camera to take color images, without illumination, even when dark.  Can be used with external (white) light sources.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"AaKEVE1YhnHb"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Ms2WW6_QKGYD"},"source":["### Mounting My Google Drive\n","The method is described under this Colab code snippet: https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/io.ipynb#scrollTo=u22w3BFiOveA.

For this reason, I use a dedicated development camera in which I have removed the EEPROM and replaced with a removable ZIFF socket.

In a pinch, these can be cribbed from images of other platforms, but it is easiest to get this header info from the target under development by \"sniffing\" the EEPROM signals during system power on (and boot). A low-cost USB logic analzyer (e.g. Kingst LA5016) turns the trace into a .CSV file.
